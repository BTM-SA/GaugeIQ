# GaugeIQ on cPanel

This guide is for a normal cPanel hosting account with PHP, Composer or SSH, SQLite, and cron support. GaugeIQ can also use MySQL/MariaDB when configured by the installer or local configuration.

## 1. Keep the application outside the public web root

The safest layout is:

```
/home/ACCOUNT/GaugeIQ/
    app/
    bin/
    config/
    cron/
    database/
    public/
    vendor/
    storage/
```

Only `GaugeIQ/public/` should be the website document root.

Do **not** point a domain or subdomain at the GaugeIQ project root. If the project root is publicly accessible, files such as `config/local.php`, the SQLite database, and PHP source outside `public/` could become exposed.

If cPanel allows you to choose the document root, use:

```
/home/ACCOUNT/GaugeIQ/public
```

## 2. Upload GaugeIQ

Upload the repository to a directory outside `public_html` when possible, for example:

```
/home/ACCOUNT/GaugeIQ
```

If your domain's document root is already configured as `/home/ACCOUNT/GaugeIQ/public`, no files need to be copied into `public_html`.

## 3. Create the local configuration

Copy:

```
config/config.example.php
```

to:

```
config/local.php
```

Edit `config/local.php` and set:

- `app.base_url` to the exact HTTPS URL where GaugeIQ will run.
- `pressure.latitude` and `pressure.longitude` to the monitoring location.
- `pressure.location_name` to the displayed location name.
- `pressure.threshold_hpa` to the pressure-change threshold.
- `push.subject` to a stable contact address or HTTPS URL.

Leave the VAPID keys empty until they are generated.

**Never put `local.php` inside `public/`.**

## 4. Install Composer dependencies

From the GaugeIQ project root:

```
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

If Composer is not available as `composer`, use the Composer command supplied by your hosting provider or cPanel Terminal.

## 5. Create the SQLite database

Run:

```
php database/migrate.php
```

This creates:

```
storage/gaugeiq.sqlite
```

The PHP process needs write access to the `storage/` directory.

## 6. Generate VAPID keys

Run:

```
php bin/generate-vapid.php
```

Copy the generated `public_key` and `private_key` into `config/local.php`.

Generate these keys once. Do not regenerate them during normal updates, because existing browser subscriptions depend on the same VAPID identity.

## 7. Check the server

Run:

```
php bin/check-requirements.php
```

The required PHP extensions are:

- `pdo_sqlite`
- `curl`
- `mbstring`
- `openssl`

Fix any `MISSING` result before continuing.

## 8. Configure the cron job

GaugeIQ checks pressure on the server, so the cron job must run even when the iPhone is asleep.

Use cPanel **Cron Jobs** and run the checker every 15 minutes:

```
php /home/ACCOUNT/GaugeIQ/cron/check-pressure.php
```

Use the PHP CLI binary provided by your host if cPanel requires an absolute executable path. You can check it from Terminal with:

```
which php
```

Do not run the cron URL through the browser. Run the PHP file from the server.

## 9. Connect the iPhone

1. Open GaugeIQ in Safari over HTTPS.
2. Add it to the Home Screen.
3. Open the Home Screen version of GaugeIQ.
4. Tap **Enable alerts**.
5. Allow notifications when iOS asks.

The browser subscription is then saved in GaugeIQ's SQLite database.

## 10. Configure weather alerts

After installation, open:

```
https://YOUR-GAUGЕIQ-URL/alerts.php
```

Create the alerts you want GaugeIQ to evaluate. Examples include:

- Pressure changing by 3 hPa or more
- Humidity rising above 75%
- Wind speed rising above 40 km/h
- Wind direction changing by 45°
- Wind arriving from NW through N while wind speed is at least 40 km/h

The alert cooldown is per rule. It prevents the same rule from generating a notification on every cron run while its condition remains active.

## 11. Test Web Push from the server

After the iPhone has enabled alerts, run:

```
php bin/test-push.php
```

You should see a message such as:

```
GaugeIQ test alert sent to 1 device(s).
```

The test command is deliberately server-side. GaugeIQ does not expose a public test-push endpoint that an anonymous visitor could use to trigger notifications to every registered device.

## 12. Installing a production release

A published GaugeIQ release package includes the Composer production dependencies in vendor/.

For a new installation:

1. Set the domain/subdomain document root to the GaugeIQ public/ directory.
2. Upload and extract the release package outside the public web root.
3. Open the GaugeIQ URL.
4. Follow the /install/ wizard.
5. Complete the monitoring location and database settings.
6. Add GaugeIQ to the iPhone Home Screen and enable notifications.
7. Configure the 15-minute cron job.

You do not need to run Composer when using an official production release package.

## 13. Updating GaugeIQ

GaugeIQ can check the official GitHub Releases feed and display an update notification on the dashboard when a newer release is available. The notification links to the published release so the package and checksum can be reviewed before installation.

For a manual update:

1. Back up config/local.php.
2. Keep the existing storage/ directory and database.
3. Upload the new release files.
4. Keep your existing config/local.php.
5. Keep your existing VAPID keys.
6. Run php database/migrate.php if the release includes database migrations.
7. Run php bin/check-requirements.php.
8. Verify the dashboard and cron monitoring.

The bundled vendor/ directory means Composer is not required when updating from an official release package.

Do not replace the existing SQLite database with a new empty database and do not regenerate VAPID keys.

The in-app release check is informational; it must not expose configuration, VAPID credentials, database contents, or internal exception details.


## Security rules

- Use HTTPS.
- Keep config/, app/, database/, cron/, bin/, storage/, and vendor/ outside the document root.
- Never commit config/local.php.
- Never publish the VAPID private key.
- Do not make storage/ publicly accessible.
- Do not expose a public endpoint that can send arbitrary push notifications.
- Treat release ZIP files and their SHA-256 checksum as a matched pair.
- Never replace config/local.php or persistent storage during an update.
